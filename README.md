# Moodle-Hacking
Hack in Moodle Exam

This hack is not based on vulnerabilities in moodle code

Due to ethical reasons , I am not sharing my code in here as it might be misused by many of you.

But I will explain you how this code works:\
I have not exploited any vulnerability in moodle, rather it is same as cheating from your notebook in exam.\
It a client-server program,\
Client:\
Client (Student) side program will send the questions to server.\
Server:\
Server side program will receive the questions and search the answers using elastic search, and send back the answer to the Client.

Elastic Search will have all the subject related OCR textbooks(Searchable)

In simple terms, it is same as someone searching the answers from a textbook to cheat in exam, but my program automatically searches the answer from the OCR textbook and sends back to the user.
